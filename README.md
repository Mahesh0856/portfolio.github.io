### Waste management and recyclying automation

OVERVIEW:  

A waste management and recycling automation system uses advanced technologies like AI, IoT, and robotics to optimize waste sorting, processing, and recycling. These systems automate manual tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy while reducing labor costs. IoT-enabled smart bins provide real-time data on waste levels, enabling timely collection and reducing overflow. AI-powered sorting systems separate recyclables with high precision, increasing recycling rates and minimizing contamination. Automation ensures sustainable waste management practices, reduces environmental impact, and promotes a circular economy by maximizing resource recovery and minimizing landfill dependency.
Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques
IMPACT:
Waste management and recycling automation significantly reduces environmental impact by improving sorting efficiency and recycling rates. It minimizes landfill waste, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves natural resources. Automation reduces labor costs, enhances safety, and ensures precise handling of materials. IoT-enabled systems optimize collection schedules, reducing fuel consumption and operational inefficiencies. Overall, it promotes a sustainable, circular economy by maximizing resource recovery and minimizing waste
